# Shopping Cart

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Shobhan Sundar Goutam. This is a Shopping Cart app where user can select the product and the number of items they want to purchase. User can also increase and decrease the number of items and can also access the cart page and make changes in it. This is made with the help of `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript`.
